# Semantic-Image-Retrieval-Engine
Overview

The Semantic Image Retrieval Engine is a powerful tool designed to enhance image search accuracy through advanced machine learning techniques. It extracts and analyzes visual features from images, enabling efficient and precise retrieval based on content similarity. This project aims to improve user experience by providing a robust and streamlined search mechanism for finding relevant images.
Features

Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Necessary Python libraries as specified in requirements.txt

Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open unspash.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to perform feature extraction.

Running the Streamlit Application
After completing the feature extraction process in the Jupyter Notebook, you can run the Streamlit application to input queries and get results.

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Streamlit file.
2. Run the Streamlit application by executing:
   streamlit run UI.py
3. The Streamlit application will start, and you can input your query to get the results based on the extracted features.

Usage
This project can be used to perform feature extraction on images for various applications such as image search, categorization, and more. The Streamlit application provides an easy-to-use interface for querying and displaying results.
